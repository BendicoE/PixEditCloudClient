# Welcome to the PixEdit Server Cloud API on GitHub!

Our API is hosted and documented on Azure. Please go to [PixEdit Cloud Developer Portal](https://pixeditservercloud.developer.azure-api.net/) for API documentation.

This repo is a Demo application for the API. It is based on React-Redux .NET Core template in Visual Studio. The source code is public and free for you to use for reference, as a boilerplate, etc. It will evolve as our API evolves, to demonstrate new functionality. Comments are welcome, but in general, we cannot commit to feature requests for the Demo app.
