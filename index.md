## Welcome to the PixEdit Cloud

This project is a demo application for our PixEdit Cloud API. Our API is hosted and documented on Azure. Please go to
[PixEdit Server Cloud on Azure](https://pixeditservercloud.developer.azure-api.net/)

The PixEdit Cloud Client application is an SPA written in ReactJS-Redux with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. It is completely open source and may be used by you as a starter to explore programming against the PixEdit Cloud API. It can also be handy as a reference, as we will update the app as the API evolves. You are also welcome to comment and ask questions about the API.
